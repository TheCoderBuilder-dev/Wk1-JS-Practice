Week 1 - JavaScript Assignment

About This Project
This repo contains my solutions for the Week 1 JavaScript Practice assignment. The goal is to practice writing JavaScript code to acc to the assignment



Challenges & Solutions

1️ Student Grade Generator 
What it does:
The program asks the user to enter a student's marks (between 0 and 100).
It then determines the grade based on the given ranges:
A → 80 and above
B → 60 to 79
C → 50 to 59
D → 40 to 49
E → Below 40
How it works:
Uses an if...else statement to check the input and return the correct grade.


2️Speed Detector 

What it does:
Takes a car’s speed as input.
If the speed is 70 or less, it prints "Ok".
If it’s above 70, for every 5 km over, it adds 1 demerit point.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, it prints "License suspended".
How it works:
Uses Math.floor() to calculate demerit points.
Uses an if...else structure to check speed conditions.

3️ Net Salary Calculator 

What it does:
Takes basic salary and benefits as input.
Calculates:
Gross salary
Tax (PAYE)
NHIF deduction
NSSF deduction
Net salary (final salary after deductions)
How it works:
Uses Kenya's tax rates and deductions (from the KRA website).
Uses formulas to calculate the final take-home salary.

Extra Practice Problems
 Bubble Sort
What it does: Sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.
How it works: Uses the Bubble Sort algorithm, which compares two numbers and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order.

 Staircase Problem
What it does:
Takes a number n and prints a staircase pattern using #.
Example for n = 3:

#
##
###

How it works: Uses nested loops to build the pattern.

Cylinder Volume Calculator
 
What it does:
Calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula:
ini
Copy
Edit
V = π * r² * h (That formula in highschool)

Then it Outputs the result rounded to 4 decimal places.
How it works:
Uses a JavaScript object with a method to calculate volume.


How to Run the Code 
Clone this repo:

git clone <repo-link>

Open the folder in VS Code or any editor.

Run the JavaScript files using Node.js:

node filename.js
(Replace filename.js with the actual file name like speedDetector.js )
